WorldMap create a pdf showing every location that I visited around the world.

world.pdf is the output
world.gp create the world map
world.dat is the data to create the map
coordinate.dat is the coordinates of the visited location

The software run is made using gnuplot:
gnuplot world.gp

Most of the work are based on work of "jack" from http://www.gnuplotting.org/plotting-the-world-revisited/
